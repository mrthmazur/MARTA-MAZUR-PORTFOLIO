I am a Junior Software Tester currently looking for a first job where I can transfer my knowledge into experience. Skilled in manual testing, bugs reporting, creating test cases and scenarios. I am familiar with SQL, DevTools, HTML, CSS, API testing, JIRA, Trello and ISTQB knowledge. Getting to know new testing areas has become my passion, that is why I am developing my skills almost every day.
